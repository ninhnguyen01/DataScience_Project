    "FILE DESCRIPTION: The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that CFPB sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily. "
